# Meteor Boilerplate

## About this project
This is my personal boilerplate code for Meteor. It sets up Meteor, React, Storybook, tests and linting.

## Installation
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/lightningboss/meteor-boilerplate.git
$ cd meteor-boilerplate
$ meteor yarn install
$ meteor
```

Make sure to update Meteor and npm packages, as well as the unique identifier in `.meteor/.id`.
